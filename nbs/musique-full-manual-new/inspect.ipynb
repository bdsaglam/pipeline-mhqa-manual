They form the band System 7 together. So, Miquette is married to Steve Hillage.\\n\\nNext, the question is about the spouse of the performer of Green. The album Green is by Steve Hillage. So, the performer in question is Steve Hillage. Therefore, his spouse would be Miquette Giraudy.\\n\\nI should make sure I\\'m not confusing any other names.
