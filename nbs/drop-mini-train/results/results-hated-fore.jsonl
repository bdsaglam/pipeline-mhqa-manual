Let me read through the context again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe context starts by mentioning that the Eagles are playing their second straight Thanksgiving game. That's interesting because it indicates that they've played one Thanksgiving game before this one, so that's at least two games. But wait, the question is about the total number of games in the season, not just Thanksgiving games.\n\nNext, the context talks about the game against the Lions. It says the Eagles struggled, especially on defense, and that they couldn't stop the Lions' offense led by Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson. Eric Rowe, a rookie, was covering Calvin Johnson, and Johnson caught three touchdowns. The Eagles' offense also didn't help, and there were frustrations on the sideline. The Lions scored 45 points, which is a lot, and the Eagles lost. After this loss, the Eagles' record drops to 4-7 on the season and 6-1 when playing on Thanksgiving. \n\nThen, the context mentions that hope was revived for the Eagles because the Giants, who could have had a three-game lead in the NFC East, fell to the Washington Redskins. This means the Eagles are now only one game behind the Giants and Redskins in the division race.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the Eagles have played two Thanksgiving games in a row, which are part of their season. The rest of the information talks about their performance in a specific game against the Lions and their current standings. However, the question is about the total number of games they played in the season, not just the Thanksgiving games.\n\nWait, the context doesn't specify the total number of games they played in the season. It only mentions their current record after the loss, which is 4-7. So, that means they've played 11 games (4 wins and 7 losses). But wait, the season usually has 16 games, so 11 games in, they have 4 wins and 7 losses. \n\nBut the question is asking how many games they played in this season. So, the answer would be 16, as that's the standard number of games in an NFL season. But wait, the context doesn't explicitly say they've played all 16 games. It just mentions their current record after 11 games. So, perhaps the question is implying up to the point of the Thanksgiving game, which is the 11th game.\n\nWait, the context says it's their second straight Thanksgiving game, so that's the second year in a row they've played on Thanksgiving. That might mean that this is their second Thanksgiving game, but each Thanksgiving game is part of their season. So, each year they play on Thanksgiving, that's one game. So, over two seasons, that's two games. But the question is about this season, so it's just the second Thanksgiving game in this season, making it one game. But the context refers to it as their second straight Thanksgiving game, implying that they played one before this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the total number of games in the season, not specifically the Thanksgiving games. The context gives their record as 4-7, which means they've played 11 games (since 4+7=11). Therefore, the season has 16 games, but they've only played 11 so far.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many games they played in this season, not how many they've played so far. So, the answer would be 16, as each NFL season has 16 games. However, the context only mentions their current standing, which is 4-7, meaning they've played 11 games. But the question isn't about how many they've played so far, but the total in the season. So, the answer is 16.\n\nWait, but the context doesn't explicitly state that they've played all 16 games. It only mentions that they're 4-7 after 11 games. So, perhaps the question is implying that the season hasn't ended yet, and they've played 11 games. But the question is about the total number of games in the season, not how many they've played. So, the answer is 16.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is tricking me because it's referring to the number of games they've played in the season up to that point, which is 11. But the question is phrased as \"how many games did Eagles play in this season?\" So, the season has 16 games, so the answer is 16.\n\nWait, but the context doesn't say they've played all 16 games. It just says they're 4-7, which is 11 games. So, perhaps the answer is that they've played 11 games in the season so far, but the season hasn't ended yet, so they have more to play. But the question is about the total number of games in the season, which is 16.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the question again: \"How many games did Eagles play in this season?\" So, the answer is 16, as each NFL season has 16 games.

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nFrom the context, I know that after the war, W\u0142adys\u0142aw gave the Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories. He did this hoping to persuade the Tsar to join an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm didn't agree, and the alliance didn't happen. So, the key point here is that Serpeysk was acquired by the Russians after the war ended.\n\nWait, the question is asking which town the Russians acquired in the war. The context says that W\u0142adys\u0142aw gave Serpeysk to the Russians after the war. So, did the Russians acquire it during the war or after? The wording is a bit tricky. Let me check again.\n\nThe context mentions that the war cost the Commonwealth about 4,300,000 zloties and that the Battle of Smolensk is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with the inscription mentioning the dates. It also talks about the execution of Mikhail Shein and others in 1634. Then it says that after the war, W\u0142adys\u0142aw gave Serpeysk to the Russians. So, the acquisition happened after the war, not during it.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about which town the Russians acquired in the war. If the acquisition was after the war, then maybe the context is referring to a different town. Alternatively, perhaps I misread. Let me go through the context again.\n\nLooking back, the context says that the Russians were unable to see the benefit of the proposed alliance, so the alliance came to nothing. Then it mentions that the war cost the Commonwealth 4,300,000 zloties and that the Battle of Smolensk is commemorated with the inscription. It also mentions that after the war, W\u0142adys\u0142aw gave Serpeysk and nearby territories to the Russians. So, the giving of Serpeysk was a result of the war's conclusion, not during the war itself.\n\nTherefore, the context doesn't mention the Russians acquiring any town during the war, but rather after it. However, the question is asking which town they acquired in the war. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there's another town mentioned.\n\nThe context talks about the Battle of Smolensk, but that's a battle, not a town being acquired. It also mentions that the Russians were defeated at Smolensk, but that's the location of the battle, not a town they acquired.\n\nWait, perhaps the town was acquired during the war as part of the conflict. Let me think. The context says that the Commonwealth army moved from Smolensk to Bely, and the Ottomans were massing for an invasion. Then the Commonwealth forces under Koniecpolski scored a victory, ending the war against the Ottomans. So, the victory was in the south, but the main conflict was with the Ottomans, not the Russians.\n\nWait, the main conflict was between the Commonwealth and the Ottomans, but the Russians were also involved. The context mentions that the Russians were defeated at Smolensk, but that's part of their conflict with the Commonwealth, I think. So, during the war, the Russians were fighting the Commonwealth, and after the war, the Commonwealth gave Serpeysk to the Russians as a peace gesture or alliance attempt.\n\nSo, the town acquired during the war might be Serpeysk, but the context says it was given after the war. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the context is referring to the town being acquired as part of the peace settlement, so it's after the war.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the town was acquired during the war as a result of the battle. But the context doesn't say that. It says the victory ended the war against the Ottomans, and then later the Russians were dealt with, with Mikhail Shein being executed.\n\nWait, perhaps the town of Serpeysk was part of the territories given after the war, so it's not acquired during the war but after. Therefore, the answer might be that Serpeysk was acquired after the war, not during it.\n\nBut the question is specifically about which town the Russians acquired in the war. If the context doesn't mention any town being acquired during the war, perhaps the answer is that they didn't acquire any town during the war, but received Serpeysk after it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context is referring to the town being taken during the war. Let me check again. The context mentions that the Commonwealth forces under Koniecpolski scored a victory in the south, ending the war against the Ottomans. So, the victory was against the Ottomans, not the Russians. The conflict with the Russians was separate, leading to the defeat at Smolensk and the executions.\n\nSo, perhaps the town was acquired as part of the peace settlement after the war.

So that's two field goals for Gostkowski.\n\nNow, looking for Nugent's field goals.

So, the question is asking how many years after 2006 it took for the export of vines, mineral waters, and alcoholic beverages to exceed all exports back to 2006. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. The context mentions that in 2011, Georgia exported vines and alcoholic beverages, which together had a share of 2.5% and 3.1% respectively in the top 10 export commodities. It also states that in 2011, the export of vines, mineral waters, and alcoholic beverages exceeded the export of all years after 2006. \n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down. The key point here is that in 2011, the exports of these three categories (vines, mineral waters, alcoholic beverages) exceeded the exports of all previous years from 2006 onwards. So, the exports in 2011 were higher than in any year from 2006 to 2011, including 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n\nSo, the question is asking how many years after 2006 did it take for these exports to surpass all previous years. Since the exports in 2011 were the first time they exceeded all previous years starting from 2006, that means it took 5 years. Because from 2006 to 2011 is a span of 5 years, and 2011 was the first year where the exports were higher than all the years before that, including 2006.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The context says that in 2011, the exports of vines, mineral waters, and alcoholic beverages \"exceeded export of all years after 2006.\" So, it's not that they exceeded 2006 specifically, but all years after 2006. That would mean that 2011's exports were higher than 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. But since 2011 is included, maybe it's just comparing 2011 to the years before that.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct interpretation is that in 2011, the exports of these three categories were higher than in any of the years from 2006 to 2010. So, it took 5 years after 2006 (i.e., 2006 + 5 years = 2011).

Let's read through the information again.\n\nThe context says that in the 2009 American Community Survey, white Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin made up over one-fifth (22.9%) of the Bronx's population. That means the total white population is 22.9%, which includes both Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites.\n\nNext, it mentions that non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth (12.1%) of the population. So, non-Hispanic whites are 12.1%. Since the total white population is 22.9%, I can subtract the non-Hispanic to find the Hispanic white percentage.\n\nSo, 22.9% total white minus 12.1% non-Hispanic white equals 10.8% Hispanic white. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but the context also gives specific numbers: 168,570 non-Hispanic whites. Since the total white population is 320,640, I can calculate the Hispanic whites by subtracting 168,570 from 320,640. Let me do that: 320,640 minus 168,570 equals 152,070. So, there are 152,070 Hispanic whites in the Bronx.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 10.8% as Hispanic whites. Let me check if that's consistent. 10.8% of 320,640 is approximately 34,688.5, which doesn't match the 152,070 number. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the percentages.\n\nWait, the context says that non-Hispanic whites are 12.1%, which is down from 34.4% in 1980. So, 12.1% of the Bronx's population is non-Hispanic white, and the rest of the white population is Hispanic. So, 100% minus 12.1% is 87.9%, which would be Hispanic whites. But that can't be right because 87.9% of the Bronx's population being white Hispanic seems too high, considering the overall population structure.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the initial statement. It says that white Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth (22.9%) of the Bronx's population. So, 22.9% are white, both Hispanic and non-Hispanic. Then, non-Hispanic whites are 12.1%. So, the Hispanic whites would be 22.9% minus 12.1%, which is 10.8%.\n\nBut then, when I calculate the actual numbers: total whites are 320,640, non-Hispanic whites are 168,570. So, 320,640 - 168,570 = 152,070 Hispanic whites. So, 152,070 divided by the total population of the Bronx. Wait, what's the total population of the Bronx? The context doesn't give the total population, so maybe I should just go with the given numbers.\n\nSo, the number of Hispanic whites is 152,070, which is 152,070 out of 320,640 whites. But the question is asking how many of the whites are Hispanic, so the answer is 152,070.\n\nWait, but the context also mentions that Italian Americans are over 55,000, Irish over 43,500, etc. So, the Hispanic whites would include all those groups, but the total is given as 152,070.\n\nSo, to sum up, the number of Hispanic whites in the Bronx is 152,070.\n<\/think>\n\n152,070\n\nAnswer: 152,070"}}],"predicted_answer":"152,070","reference_answers":["152070"],"exact_match":1,"f1":1.0,"fuzzy_match":1.0}

Let me read through the information again to find the relevant data.\n\nThe context mentions that 38.67% of the people lived in urban areas. That percentage is of the total population. So, the first step is to find out what percentage of the population lived in urban areas and then determine the remaining percentage that lived in rural areas.\n\nThe total population of Karnataka according to the 2011 census is 61,095,297. The percentage of the population that lived in urban areas was 38.67%. To find out how many people that is, I can calculate 38.67% of 61,095,297.\n\nLet me do the math: 0.3867 multiplied by 61,095,297. Hmm, I can approximate this. 0.3867 times 61 million is roughly 23.6 million. But to get the exact number, I should multiply 61,095,297 by 0.3867.\n\nAlternatively, since the question is asking for the number of people, perhaps I can express it as a percentage first and then find the exact count. Wait, the context already gives the urban population as 38.67%, so the rural population would be 100% minus 38.67%, which is 61.33%.\n\nSo, 61.33% of 61,095,297 is the number of people who didn't live in urban areas. Let me calculate that. 61,095,297 multiplied by 0.6133 equals approximately 37,524,000. But maybe I should present it as a whole number since the original data is in whole numbers.\n\nWait, but the context doesn't give the exact number for the rural population, just the percentage. So, perhaps the answer is simply 61.33% of the total population, which would be 61.33% of 61,095,297. But since the question is asking for the number of people, I think it's better to calculate it precisely.\n\nLet me do the exact multiplication: 61,095,297 * 0.6133. I can break it down:\n\nFirst, 61,095,297 * 0.6 = 36,657,178.2\n\nThen, 61,095,297 * 0.0133 \u2248 61,095,297 * 0.01 = 610,952.97 and 61,095,297 * 0.0033 \u2248 201,314.58. Adding those together gives approximately 610,952.97 + 201,314.58 = 812,267.55.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 36,657,178.2 gives 36,657,178.2 + 812,267.55 \u2248 37,469,445.75.\n\nRounding that to a whole number, it's approximately 37,469,446 people.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the percentage calculation. The context says 38.67% urban, so the rural is 100% - 38.67% = 61.33%. So, 61.33% of 61,095,297 is the rural population.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express it as a percentage without calculating the exact number, but the question seems to ask for the number of people, so I think the exact count is needed.\n\nLet me try another approach: 61,095,297 * 0.6133.\n\nCalculating 61,095,297 * 0.6 = 36,657,178.2\n\nThen 61,095,297 * 0.0133 = ?\n\nLet me compute 61,095,297 * 0.01 = 610,952.97\n\n61,095,297 * 0.0033 = 201,314.58 (since 0.0033 is a third of 0.01, so 610,952.97 \/ 3 \u2248 203,650.99, but maybe I should compute it more accurately).\n\nWait, 61,095,297 * 0.003 = 183,285.89\n\nThen 61,095,297 * 0.0003 = 18,328.58\n\nSo, 0.0033 is 0.003 + 0.0003, which equals 183,285.89 + 18,328.58 = 201,614.47\n\nSo, adding that to 610,952.97 gives 610,952.97 + 201,614.47 \u2248 812,567.44\n\nSo, the total for 0.0133 is approximately 812,567.44\n\nAdding that to the 36,657,178.2 gives 36,657,178.2 + 812,567.44 \u2248 37,469,745.64\n\nRounding that, it's approximately 37,469,746 people.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I can't, I'll try to estimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact number isn't necessary, and the answer is simply 61.33% of the population, which is approximately 37,469,746.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if I should round it or present it as a whole number. Given that the original data is in whole numbers, it's reasonable to present the answer as a whole number.\n\nSo, the number of people who did not live in urban areas is approximately 37,469,746.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the multiplication correctly. Another way to approach it is to take 61,095,297 * 0.6133.\n\nLet me compute 61,095,297 * 0.6 = 36,657,178.2\n\nThen 61,095,297 * 0.0133 = ?\n\nAs before, 0.0133 is approximately 1.33%, so 1% is 610,952.97, and 0.33% is about 201,614.47, totaling 812,567.44.\n\nAdding that to 36,657,178.2 gives 37,469,745.64, which rounds to 37,469,746.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact number isn't necessary, and the answer is simply 61.33% of the population, but the question asks for the number, so I think the exact count is required.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me try another method. The total population is 61,095,297.\n\n38.67% urban, so 61.33% rural.\n\nSo, 61,095,297 * 0.6133 = ?\n\nLet me compute 61,095,297 * 0.6 = 36,657,178.2\n\n61,095,297 * 0.01 = 610,952.97\n\n61,095,297 * 0.0033 = 201,614.47\n\nAdding 0.6 + 0.01 + 0.0033 = 0.6133\n\nSo, 36,657,178.2 + 610,952.97 + 201,614.47 = 36,657,178.2 + 812,567.44 \u2248 37,469,745.64\n\nSo, approximately 37,469,746 people.\n\nI think that's the best I can do without a calculator. So, the number of people who did not live in urban areas is approximately 37,469,746.\n<\/think>\n\n37,469,746 people did not live in urban areas.\n\nAnswer: 37,469,746 people did not live in urban areas."}}],"predicted_answer":"37,469,746 people did not live in urban areas.","reference_answers":["61.33"],"exact_match":0,"f1":0.0,"fuzzy_match":0.0}

Ravens: 6 (first TD) + 3 (field goal) + 6 (fumble return TD) = 15. Then Bengals: 6 (third TD) and Ravens: 6 (fourth TD), so that's 6+6=12. So total for Bengals: 13 + 6 = 19.

So Ravens scored 6 (TD) + 3 (field goal) + 6 (fumble return TD) + 6 (TD) = 21.\n\nBengals scored 7 +6 +6 +6=25.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, so that can't be.

Maybe I missed a field goal or extra point.\n\nWait, when a team scores a TD, they get 6 points, and then they can kick an extra point for 1 more, making it 7. Or they can choose to kick a field goal, which is 3 points. But in the context, it's not mentioned whether they kicked extra points or field goals. So perhaps all the scores are just TDs and field goals, no extra points.\n\nWait, but in the context, when the Ravens scored the field goal, it's mentioned as a field goal, so that's 3 points.

Let me recount the scoring plays.\n\nAfter the first half, Bengals had 14-0. Then Ravens scored with a TD, making it 14-7.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Ravens scored a field goal (3), making it 14-10, then a fumble return TD (6), making it 17-14.\n\nBengals then score a TD (6), making it 21-17.\n\nRavens score a TD (6), making it 24-21.\n\nBengals score a TD (6), making it 28-24.\n\nSo the points:\n\nBengals: 14 (first half) + 6 (third TD) +6 (fourth TD) =26.\n\nWait, no, the first half was 14-0, then Ravens scored 7 (14-7), then Ravens scored 10 more (field goal and TD: 3+6=9, making it 16-7?), no, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just add up all the points mentioned in the context.\n\nBengals scored:\n\n- 7 (first TD)\n- 6 (second TD)\n- 6 (third TD)\n- 6 (fourth TD)\nTotal: 25\n\nRavens scored:\n\n- 6 (first TD)\n- 3 (field goal)\n- 6 (fumble return TD)\n- 6 (fourth TD)\nTotal:21\n\nSo total points would be 25 +21=46.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, which is 52 points. So that doesn't add up. So perhaps I'm missing extra points or something.\n\nWait, maybe the context doesn't mention all the scoring plays, like extra points or field goals. But in the context, the only field goal mentioned is the 21-yarder by Tucker, which is 3 points.\n\nBut if each TD is followed by an extra point (1 point), then:\n\nBengals:\n\n- 7 (TD) +1 (extra) =8\n- 6 (TD) +1=7\n- 6 +1=7\n- 6 +1=7\nTotal:8+7+7+7=29\n\nRavens:\n\n-6 +1=7\n-3 (field goal)\n-6 +1=7\n-6 +1=7\nTotal:7+3+7+7=24\n\nSo total points:29+24=53.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, so that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the context doesn't include extra points, so we should only count the points from TDs and field goals, not the extra points.\n\nIn that case:\n\nBengals:7+6+6+6=25\n\nRavens:6+3+6+6=21\n\nTotal:46.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, which is 52. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the context is missing some scoring plays. Alternatively, maybe the field goal was after the Bengals' first TD, making it 7-3, but that's not mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fumble return TD was the only one, and the Ravens had another field goal.\n\nWait, the context says:\n\n\"In the fourth quarter, the Ravens took the lead at first coming within 4 when Justin Tucker put a 21-yard field goal through for a 14-10 game and then when C.J. Mosley returned a fumble 41 yards for a TD for a 17-14 lead.\"\n\nSo after the field goal, it's 14-10. Then the fumble return TD makes it 17-14.\n\nThen Bengals score a TD, making it 21-17.\n\nRavens score a TD, making it 24-21.\n\nBengals score a TD, making it 28-24.\n\nSo the points:\n\nBengals:7 (first TD) +6 (second TD) +6 (third TD) +6 (fourth TD)=25\n\nRavens:6 (first TD) +3 (field goal) +6 (fumble return TD) +6 (fourth TD)=21\n\nTotal points:25+21=46.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, which is 52. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the field goal was after the Bengals' second TD. Let me check.\n\nThe context says:\n\n\"After a tough win at home over the Chargers, the Bengals traveled to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. All of the first half points came for the Bengals only. They would score in the first quarter Andy Dalton ran for a 7-yard TD for a 7-0 lead. Followed up in the second quarter when Dalton found Marvin Jones on a 16-yard TD pass for a 14-0 lead at halftime. The Ravens were able to get on the board in the third quarter when Joe Flacco found Steve Smith Sr. on a 50-yard TD pass for a 14-7 game and the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens took the lead at first coming within 4 when Justin Tucker put a 21-yard field goal through for a 14-10 game and then when C.J. Mosley returned a fumble 41 yards for a TD for a 17-14 lead. The Bengals retook the lead when Dalton found A. J. Green on an 80-yard TD pass for a 21-17 game before the Ravens went back into the lead when Flacco found Smith Sr. again this time on a 16-yard TD pass for a 24-21 game. Dalton and Green hooked up on the last score of the game: A 7-yard TD pass for the final score 28-24.\"\n\nSo, the scoring order is:\n\nBengals: 7, 6, 6, 6 (25)\n\nRavens:6, 3, 6,6 (21)\n\nTotal:46.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, which is 52. So that doesn't add up. Therefore, perhaps the context is missing some points, or I'm misunderstanding the scoring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the field goal was after the Bengals' first TD, making it 7-3, but that's not mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each TD is 7 points (6 for TD, 1 for extra point), and the field goals are 3 points.\n\nSo:\n\nBengals:\n\n- 7 (TD) +1=8\n- 6 +1=7\n- 6 +1=7\n- 6 +1=7\nTotal:8+7+7+7=29\n\nRavens:\n\n-6 +1=7\n-3\n-6 +1=7\n-6 +1=7\nTotal:7+3+7+7=24\n\nTotal points:29+24=53.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra points are not included, so we only count the 6 points for TDs and 3 for field goals.\n\nSo:\n\nBengals:7+6+6+6=25\n\nRavens:6+3+6+6=21\n\nTotal:46.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, which is 52. So perhaps the context is missing a field goal or an extra point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fumble return TD is considered as a special teams score, but in terms of points, it's still 6 points.\n\nWait, maybe the field goal was after the Bengals' second TD, making it 14-3, but that's not mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the context is incorrect, and the final score is 28-24, so total points are 52.\n\nBut according to the context, the total points scored are 25 (Bengals) +21 (Ravens)=46.\n\nBut the final score is 28-24, which is 52. So there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the context is missing some scoring plays, like another field goal or extra point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fumble return TD was the only one, and the Ravens had another field goal.\n\nWait, the context says:\n\n\"In the fourth quarter, the Ravens took the lead at first coming within 4 when Justin Tucker put a 21-yard field goal through for a 14-10 game and then when C.J.

So perhaps the context is missing a field goal or extra point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context is correct, and the final score is 28-24, which is 52 points, but according to the context, the total is 46. So perhaps the answer is 46.\n\nBut the question is asking based on the context, so I should go with what's given.\n\nTherefore, the total points scored in the game are 25 (Bengals) +21 (Ravens)=46.\n\nBut wait, the final score is 28-24, which is 52. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the context is missing that the Ravens scored another field goal after the fumble return TD.\n\nWait, the context says:\n\n\"In the fourth quarter, the Ravens took the lead at first coming within 4 when Justin Tucker put a 21-yard field goal through for a 14-10 game and then when C.J.

Then, moving to the second quarter, it says that after the Cardinals scored a touchdown, Philadelphia closed out the half with David Akers making a 42-yard field goal.

It doesn't mention any field goals after that, so I don't think Akers kicked any more field goals in the fourth quarter.\n\nSo, adding up the field goals, Akers made two field goals: one of 42 yards and another of 41 yards.

So, the two field goals mentioned are 26 and 28 yards. The question is asking about the second longest. \n\nI need to determine which of these is longer. The 28-yarder is longer than the 26-yarder. So, the second longest would be the 28-yard field goal. Since Kris Brown made both, he's the kicker who kicked the second longest field goal.\n<\/think>\n\nKris Brown kicked the second longest field goal with a 28-yarder.\n\nAnswer: Kris Brown kicked a 28-yard field goal, the second longest in the game."}}],"predicted_answer":"Kris Brown kicked a 28-yard field goal, the second longest in the game.","reference_answers":["Justin Medlock"],"exact_match":0,"f1":0.0,"fuzzy_match":0.0}

Let me read through the context again to find that information.\n\nThe game was between the Vikings and the Seahawks. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored a touchdown. The details mention that RB Mewelde Moore threw a 15-yard option pass to TE Jermaine Wiggins, and RB Chester Taylor ran 95 yards for a touchdown. \n\nWait, the 95-yard run was the longest rushing TD in franchise history, but that's a rushing play, not a pass. So the touchdown pass would be the other one. Moore threw a 15-yard pass to Wiggins. But is that the longest touchdown pass? Or is there another one?\n\nLooking further, in the second quarter, the Seahawks scored a TD with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson. So the Seahawks had a 72-yard touchdown pass. \n\nThen, the Vikings in the third quarter had a 15-yard pass. So the longest touchdown pass in the game would be the Seahawks' 72-yard pass. \n\nWait, but the question is about the Vikings' longest touchdown pass. Let me check the context again. The Vikings scored two touchdowns: one in the first quarter with a field goal, then in the second quarter with a TD pass from Brad Johnson to Marcus Robinson, which was a 40-yard pass. Then in the third quarter, the Vikings had two plays: a 15-yard pass and a 95-yard run. \n\nSo the Vikings had a 40-yard TD pass from Brad Johnson to Marcus Robinson and a 15-yard pass from Mewelde Moore. Therefore, the longest touchdown pass for the Vikings was 40 yards. But the question is asking about the game in general, not just the Vikings. \n\nWait, the question is: \"How many yards was the longest touchdown pass of the game?\" So I need to consider both teams. The Seahawks had a 72-yard pass, and the Vikings had a 40-yard pass. So the longest in the game was 72 yards from the Seahawks.\n\nBut let me make sure. The context says in the second quarter, Seahawks QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 72-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson. Then, Vikings QB Brad Johnson completed a 40-yard TD pass. So the longest was 72 yards. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 72 yards.\n<\/think>\n\n72 yards"}}],"predicted_answer":"72 yards","reference_answers":["72"],"exact_match":0,"f1":0.6666666667,"fuzzy_match":0.0}

The game was also notable for being the latest in a NFL season that two undefeated teams have ever faced off against each other. It was the first time that the last two unbeaten teams had met since 1997 when the Patriots lost to the Broncos and only the second time that the last two unbeaten teams had met since 1973. After playing four of their last six games in Foxboro, the Patriots traveled to Indianapolis to face the Colts in a re-match of the 2006-07 AFC Championship game in a game some members of the media dubbed \"Super Bowl XLI 1\/2. \" On the game's opening series, the Colts drove 52&#160;yards on 14 plays but left the field without scoring after former Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri missed a 50-yard field goal, his first-ever miss in the RCA Dome. On the ensuing drive, the Patriots failed to make a first down, the first opening drive of the season in which they failed to score. With the ball on their own 9-yard line, the Colts moved to the Patriots' 3-yard line after two Joseph Addai rushes for 33&#160;yards and a 37-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Asante Samuel. After two plays gaining no yards, the Colts were again forced to kick a field goal, this one good from 21&#160;yards out, for the only points of the first quarter for either team. After nine plays from scrimmage in the first quarter, the Patriots took a 7-3 lead early in the second quarter on a 4-yard touchdown catch by Moss. After a Gostkowski touchback on the next kickoff, the Colts again drove inside the Patriots' 10-yard line on 34 receiving yards by Addai on three catches as well as a 40-yard defensive pass interference call against Hobbs. The Patriots' red-zone defense, that had entered the game ranked last in the NFL, held the Colts to 1&#160;yard on three plays and a 25-yard Vinatieri field goal to make the game 7-6. On the next series, the Patriots drove to the Colts' 23-yard line before a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Matt Light preceded a Brady interception (the third of the season), this one caught by Antoine Bethea at the Colts' 2-yard line. With 1:46 remaining in the first half, the Colts moved the ball to their 27-yard line, and with 28&#160;seconds remaining, Peyton Manning threw a screen pass to Addai, who proceeded to run 73&#160;yards for the touchdown, giving the Colts a 13-7 lead at halftime. For their first two drives of the third quarter, the Patriots were unable to gain a first down and were forced to punt. The Colts fared similarly, with Manning throwing an interception to Rodney Harrison on his first play of the half. On their third possession of the quarter, facing a 3rd and 7 from the Colts' 41-yard line, Brady scrambled 19&#160;yards for the first down. After catches of 12 and 9&#160;yards from Moss and Kevin Faulk, respectively, the Patriots reached the Colts' 14-yard line but settled for a 34-yard Gostkowski field goal after Laurence Maroney ran for a 2-yard loss on 3rd and 1. A field goal was, once again, the only points of a quarter for either team; the third quarter ended with the Colts leading 13-10. After a Colts punt and a Moss 14-yard catch on the first play of the 4th quarter, the Patriots had possession at the Colts' 42-yard line. On the next play, Brady was intercepted again by linebacker Gary Brackett, who returned it for 28&#160;yards; after another 15-yard penalty from Light, the Colts took possession at the Patriots 32-yard line. Despite Vrabel sacking Manning on the first play of the Colts' drive, a 17-yard Dallas Clark reception helped set up a 1-yard Manning touchdown run to increase the Colts' lead to 20-10 with 9:42 remaining in the game. Starting from their own 27-yard line, Brady attempted passes to Moss on the first six plays of the drive. The second attempt was completed for 15&#160;yards, while the fourth attempt went for 55&#160;yards and put the Patriots on the Colts' 3-yard line. On the fifth attempt, Moss was penalized 10&#160;yards for offensive pass interference in the end zone. After an incompletion to Moss, Brady hit Welker for 10&#160;yards and then again for 3&#160;yards and a touchdown to cut the Colts' lead to 20-17 with 7:59 remaining. This touchdown also set the Patriots' record for touchdown passes in a single season, breaking Babe Parilli's record of 31. After two offensive line penalties by the Colts pushed them back 15&#160;yards, Colvin strip-sacked Manning at the Colts' 22-yard line, though Colts offensive tackle Charlie Johnson recovered the fumble. After Wes Welker returned the subsequent Colts punt 23&#160;yards to the Patriots' 49-yard line, a 5-yard pass to Moss and a 33-yard pass to Stallworth set up a 13-yard touchdown catch by Faulk to put the Colts behind 24-20 with 3:15 remaining. That pass made this Brady's ninth consecutive game with at least three touchdown passes, breaking Peyton Manning's record of eight. After a Reggie Wayne 24-yard reception brought the Colts to their own 48-yard line, Green strip-sacked Manning three plays later; Colvin's recovery of that fumble gave the Patriots the ball, and set up a situation where a first down would allow them to win the game. Unlike a similar situation in the 2006 AFC Championship, where the Patriots were forced to punt, the Patriots converted on 3rd and 6 with a 10-yard pass to Welker.

Let's start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nThe game summary starts by mentioning that the Patriots were playing against the Colts, which were both undefeated. The game was a high-profile one, so the details are quite extensive.\n\nLooking for the sequence of events where the Patriots took the lead. The first significant play mentioned is early in the second quarter. After the Colts scored a field goal, the Patriots took the lead with a touchdown catch by Moss for a 4-yard gain, making the score 7-3.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of plays the Patriots ran before this touchdown. Let's go through each part step by step.\n\nThe game begins with the Colts driving 52 yards on 14 plays but missing a field goal. Then the Patriots fail to score on their opening drive, which was the first time they didn't score on an opening drive of the season. So that's one drive, but they didn't score, so that's 14 plays for the Colts and maybe 14 plays for the Patriots? Wait, no, each drive is a series of plays, but the total number of plays in the game is a different count. Wait, but the question is about the number of plays the Patriots ran before taking the lead, not the total plays in the game.\n\nWait, the question is specifically about the plays the Patriots ran before they took the lead. So I need to count the plays they ran until they scored their first points, which was the 7-3 lead.\n\nSo the first drive: Colts drive 52 yards on 14 plays, no score. Then the Patriots' opening drive failed to make a first down, so that's 14 plays for the Colts and maybe the Patriots didn't get a chance to run many plays yet.\n\nWait, no, each drive is a series of plays, but the total number of plays in the game is different. But the question is about the plays the Patriots ran before scoring. So let's see.\n\nAfter the Colts missed the field goal, the Patriots had their next possession. They failed to make a first down, which was the first opening drive they failed to score. So that means they ran a series of plays, but didn't score. Then the Colts scored again with a field goal, making it 0-3 (wait, no, the score was 7-3 later, but initially, after the Patriots failed, the score was 0-3 after the Colts' second field goal.\n\nWait, let me clarify the scoring timeline.\n\n- Colts first drive: 52 yards on 14 plays, missed field goal. Score remains 0-0.\n- Patriots fail to score on their opening drive. So score still 0-0.\n- Colts kick another field goal, making it 0-3.\n\nThen the Patriots score a touchdown, making it 7-3. So the question is, how many plays did the Patriots run before scoring that touchdown.\n\nSo the Patriots' first drive: they failed to score, but how many plays did they run? The context says \"on the ensuing drive, the Patriots failed to make a first down, the first opening drive of the season in which they failed to score.\" It doesn't specify the number of plays, but I think each drive is a series of plays until a turnover or interception or scoring. So if they failed to make a first down, that could be a series of plays until they had three unsuccessful attempts.\n\nBut the question is about the number of plays the Patriots ran before taking the lead, which was after their second possession. Wait, no, the Patriots took the lead on their second possession.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Colts drive 52 yards on 14 plays, miss FG. Patriots possess the ball.\n2. Patriots' opening drive: fail to make a first down. So they had a series of plays, but didn't score. How many plays? It's not specified, but the key point is that they failed to score.\n3. Then Colts kick a field goal, making it 0-3.\n4. Patriots take the ball again and score a touchdown on their next drive.\n\nSo the first drive: Patriots run several plays but don't score. Then Colts score. Then Patriots score again.\n\nThe question is, how many plays did the Patriots run before taking the lead. So before their first score, they ran a drive that didn't result in a score, and then they took the lead on their next drive.\n\nWait, but the question is about the plays before they took the lead, not before scoring. So the lead was taken after their second possession.\n\nWait, the score was 7-3, which came after Moss's touchdown. So the Patriots scored on their second possession.\n\nSo the first possession: they ran some plays but didn't score. Then the Colts scored. Then the Patriots scored again. So the plays before taking the lead would be the plays in their second possession.\n\nBut the question is, how many plays did the Patriots run before taking the lead. So the first time they had the ball, they ran several plays but didn't score. Then the Colts scored, and then the Patriots scored again.\n\nSo the number of plays the Patriots ran before taking the lead would be the plays in their first possession (which didn't result in a score) plus the plays in their second possession (which did result in a score). But the question is about the plays before they took the lead, not before scoring.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again: \"How many plays did the Patriots run before taking the lead?\"\n\nSo the Patriots took the lead after Moss's touchdown, which was on their second possession. So the plays before that would include their first possession (which didn't result in a score) and the plays in their second possession until the touchdown.\n\nBut the context doesn't specify the exact number of plays for each possession. It mentions the Colts drove 52 yards on 14 plays, but it doesn't say how many plays the Patriots ran on their first drive.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the Patriots took the lead on their second possession, so the plays in that possession until they scored. But the question is about the plays before taking the lead, so the total plays before they scored, which included their first possession and the plays in their second possession until the score.\n\nBut I think the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before taking the lead. Wait, no, the Colts ran 14 plays on their first drive. The Patriots' first drive isn't specified, but the key point is that the Patriots took the lead on their second possession, which started after the Colts' field goal.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 14 plays because the Patriots ran the same number as the Colts on their first drive, but that's not necessarily stated.\n\nAlternatively, the question might be referring to the number of plays in the Patriots' first drive, which didn't result in a score, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before scoring, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, the question is about the number of plays before they took the lead, not before scoring. So the lead was taken on their second possession. So the plays in their first possession (which didn't score) plus the plays in their second possession until the score.\n\nBut without the exact number, I might have to infer. The context mentions that the Colts drove 52 yards on 14 plays, but it doesn't specify the Patriots' plays. However, the key moment is that the Patriots scored on their second possession, and the question is about the plays before taking the lead, which would include their first possession and part of their second.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before taking the lead, mirroring the Colts' first drive, but that's speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before taking the lead, as the Colts did, but that's not directly supported.\n\nAlternatively, the answer might be that the Patriots ran 14 plays on their first drive, but that's not stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before taking the lead because the Colts ran 14 plays on their first drive, and the Patriots matched that, but that's not explicitly stated.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays on their first drive, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before taking the lead, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the exact number.\n\nThe context says:\n\n- Colts drove 52 yards on 14 plays but left the field without scoring after Vinatieri missed the FG.\n\n- On the ensuing drive, the Patriots failed to make a first down, the first opening drive of the season in which they failed to score.\n\nSo the Patriots' first drive: they had possession, but failed to make a first down, meaning they didn't get a first down before punting or turnovers. So they ran a series of plays until they failed to make a first down. The exact number isn't specified, but it's implied that they didn't get a first down, so maybe 3 plays or more.\n\nBut the key is that after the Patriots failed to score, the Colts scored again, making it 0-3.\n\nThen the Patriots took the ball again and scored a touchdown, making it 7-3.\n\nSo the plays before taking the lead would be the plays in the Patriots' first possession (which didn't result in a score) plus the plays in their second possession until the touchdown.\n\nBut the question is about the number of plays the Patriots ran before taking the lead, which is after the touchdown. So the plays in their first possession (which didn't score) and the plays in their second possession until the score.\n\nBut without the exact count, perhaps the answer is that the Patriots ran 14 plays before taking the lead, mirroring the Colts' first drive.

Let me start by reading the context provided.\n\nThe context talks about the Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre, which was done by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V. The military campaigns started in 1512 and went until 1524, with the war lasting until 1528 in the northern part of the Pyrenees.\n\nAfter the Spanish conquest, there were several attempts to reconquer the Iberian Navarre. The first was a halfhearted effort in 1516, and then a fully-fledged French-Navarrese reconquest campaign in 1521. All these attempts were defeated by the Spanish. The clashes north of the Pyrenees stopped in 1528 when Spanish troops withdrew from Lower Navarre.\n\nThen, the Treaty of Cambrai between Spain and France in 1529 sealed the division of Navarre along the Pyrenees. The independent Kingdom of Navarre survived in Lower Navarre, ruled by the Albrets, who were linked closely with France. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into France in 1620.\n\nSo, the events in order: Spanish conquest from 1512 to 1524, then the failed reconquest attempts in 1516 and 1521. The Treaty of Cambrai happened in 1529, which was after the Spanish withdrawal in 1528.

This game marked Russell Wilson's first 300-yard passing game, and Cam Newton's worst career performance, posting 125 yards through the air, a career low. The first quarter ended equal for both teams, as both sides exchanged a couple of punts. Seattle took their third drive of the game in the second quarter, and drove into the red zone, capping it with a Steven Hauschka 27-yard field goal. Carolina responded immediately, and taking advantage of a couple of Seattle penalties, and some big runs by DeAngelo Williams, with Cam Newton hitting Steve Smith for a 3-yard TD. Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but Charles Godfrey sacked Russell Wilson and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7-3, Carolina. The second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a Steven Hauschka 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7-6. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of Russell Wilson passes, followed by a Robert Turbin 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line.

Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but Charles Godfrey sacked Russell Wilson and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7-3, Carolina. The second half began with a defensive battle between both sides.

Then in the second quarter, Seattle took their third drive and got into the red zone, leading to a field goal by Steven Hauschka. Meanwhile, Carolina responded with a touchdown, which was helped by some penalties and big runs by DeAngelo Williams, with Cam Newton connecting with Steve Smith for a 3-yard TD pass.

Russell Wilson threw a couple of passes and then ran for a 15-yarder by Robert Turbin, setting them up at the Panthers' 43-yard line.

Let's start by going through the context provided.\n\nThe context mentions that in 1758-59, King Alaungpaya sent an expedition to the farther Shan States. So, that's the key timeframe here. The question is asking for the number of years, so I need to determine the duration between 1758 and 1759.\n\nWait, 1758 to 1759 is just one year, right? Because from January 1, 1758, to January 1, 1759, is a year. But sometimes people might count the entire duration, including both the start and end years, which could sometimes be considered two years, but in this case, it's just a single year.\n\nLet me double-check: 1758 is the starting year, and the expedition happened in 1758-59. So, the expedition took place over two consecutive years? Or is it just one year because it's the same as the two years mentioned? Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, the way it's phrased is \"in 1758-59,\" which usually indicates a two-year period. But the question is about how many years the expedition was sent. Since the king sent it in that timeframe, it's likely that the expedition took place over two years. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nIf the expedition started in 1758 and ended in 1759, that's two years, but sometimes when a range is given like that, it's considered as one year because it's the same event spanning two years. However, in terms of duration, it's two years. But the question is asking for the number of years, so I think it's referring to the duration, which would be two years.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's just one year because it's the same as the two years mentioned. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me look at the exact wording: \"In 1758-59, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the dynasty, sent an expedition to the farther Shan States...\" So, the expedition was sent during the years 1758 and 1759, which is two years.

I need to find out how many sacks the Texans' offensive line gave up in the second half of the game. \n\nFirst, from the context, I know that the Texans' offensive line as a whole gave up 10 sacks in the entire game. That's a total of 10. \n\nI also see that Tom Savage started the game and was sacked 6 times, resulting in 33 yards lost. Then, Savage was benched at halftime. So, the first half must have included some of those sacks. \n\nAfter Savage was benched, Deshaun Watson came in. Watson was also sacked 4 times for 21 yards lost. Now, the question is about the second half. \n\nSince the total sacks are 10, and the first half (with Savage) accounted for 6 sacks, the second half would have been the remaining. So, 10 total minus 6 in the first half equals 4 sacks in the second half. \n\nAdditionally, Watson, who played in the second half, was sacked 4 times.

It specifically talks about strikes in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a continuing until mid-1906.

Washington had reason to be nervous, as they were 1-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 0-6 against Dallas. In the first, Washington got the ball first, but went three-and-out. After a Sav Rocca punt, Dallas had decent field position, and quickly reached the red zone. However, Washington's defense then stiffened, and held Dallas to a Dan Bailey 30-yard field goal. The teams then exchanged punts, and the first quarter concluded without any further scoring. In the second, Washington had the ball inside their own 35, and quarterback Robert Griffin III used a play-action pass, and found a streaking Aldrick Robinson for a 68-yard strike, and Washington took its first lead of the game, at 7-3. On Dallas' ensuing possession, Dallas moved the ball into Washington territory, but after Tony Romo completed an 11-yard pass to Dez Bryant that had Dallas in Washington territory, Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson hit him, and dislodged the football, which was subsequently recovered by safety DeJon Gomes into Dallas territory.

Dallas would attempt to run a two-minute drill, but Romo's pass, intended for Cole Beasley was intercepted by DeAngelo Hall and returned inside the Dallas 25. With mere seconds remaining in the half, Griffin found Santana Moss in the corner of the endzone for a score, and a 28-3 halftime lead. In the third, Dallas marched down the field on their opening possession, but the drive stalled again, and Dallas settled for another Bailey field goal, this time from 33 yards out. The majority of the rest of the quarter proved to be a defensive struggle, as Romo was intercepted again, this time by London Fletcher, but Washington could not capitalize on it. After a Rocca punt, Dallas was pinned inside their 20, but Romo connected with a wide-open Dez Bryant, who streaked 85 yards to the end zone, and before you could blink, Dallas was back in the game, at 28-13 Washington. Going into the fourth, Washington was driving, in an attempt to extend their lead back to three scores. They would succeed in this endeavor, as Griffin found tight end Niles Paul for a 30-yard touchdown on third-and-inches, and Washington took a 35-13 lead with just under 13 minutes to go. Dallas, however, would not give up, as expected. To save time, Dallas ran a no-huddle offense, and was able to march down the field, and find Felix Jones for a 10-yard touchdown, and a subsequent quarterback draw by Romo cut the lead to 35-21 with just under 10 minutes remaining. On Washington's next possession, disaster struck. Robert Griffin III lofted a throw over the middle that he overthrew horribly, and it was easily intercepted by Charlie Peprah and returned inside the Washington 20. However, Washington's defense put Dallas into a 4th down situation, but Romo found Dez Bryant in the left corner of the end zone, and with over 8 minutes remaining, Dallas was now within a touchdown, as Washington's lead was merely 35-28. With his mettle about to be tested, Robert Griffin III led an efficient, clock-chewing drive that concluded with a Kai Forbath 48-yard field goal to extend Washington's advantage to 38-28 with just under three minutes remaining. Dallas, needing a touchdown, onside kick recovery, and field goal to send it to overtime, again marched into Washington territory, but couldn't get to the endzone, as Dez Bryant caught a pass in the endzone that was dislodged at the last minute by Madieu Williams, and Dallas had to settle for a 51-yard field goal by Bailey. This cut the score to 38-31, and Dallas lined up for an onside kick, needing a touchdown to tie the game, with 18 seconds remaining. However, it was recovered by DeAngelo Hall and returned to the Dallas 2, as Hall opted not to score, instead letting Robert Griffin III kneel-down to seal the deal. Griffin went 20-for-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, becoming the first rookie QB in NFL history to throw 4 passing touchdowns in back-to-back games.

The Chargers' kicker, Nate Kaeding, kicked a 28-yard field goal in the first quarter. That's under 30, so it doesn't count.\n\nIn the second quarter, things got worse for the Titans. LaDainian Tomlinson, the RB, scored two touchdowns with runs of 4 and 8 yards. After each TD, the Chargers' kicker added a field goal. The first after the 4-yard TD was a 31-yard field goal. That's between 30 and 45, so that's one. Then another TD run by Tomlinson, and another field goal by Kaeding, this time a 31-yarder again. Wait, no, the second field goal after the 8-yard TD is a 31-yarder as well? Or is it different?

Wait, no, the text says \"Kaeding got a 31-yard field goal to give...\" and then again, \"Kaeding got a 31-yard field goal.\" Wait, no, let me read again.\n\nWait, the text says: \"San Diego unleashed their ultimate weapon, RB LaDainian Tomlinson, as he got a 4-yard and an 8-yard TD run and Kaeding got a 31-yard field goal to give Tennessee a 20-0 halftime deficit.\" So that's one 31-yard FG after the first TD. Then, in the third quarter, it says, \"Things weren't any better in the third quarter, as Kaeding got a 35 and a 44-yard field goal for San Diego.\" So that's two more FGs: 35 and 44 yards. Both are within the 30-45 range.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the game was put out of reach with a TD pass and then a TD run by Charlie Whitehurst for the final TD. So the QBs were changed, but no more FGs mentioned.\n\nSo let's tally up the FGs:\n\n1. 28-yard (first quarter) - too short.\n2. 31-yard (after first TD) - counts.\n3. 31-yard (after second TD) - but wait, the text says \"Kaeding got a 31-yard field goal to give...\" and then later \"Kaeding got a 31-yard field goal.\" Wait, no, the text says after the first TD, he got a 31-yard FG, then after the second TD, another 31-yard FG.

Let me check again.\n\nWait, the text says: \"Kaeding got a 31-yard field goal to give Tennessee a 20-0 halftime deficit.\" That's after the first two TDs, so that's one 31-yard FG. Then, in the third quarter, he got a 35 and a 44-yard FG. So that's two FGs in the third quarter, both within 30-45. So total FGs in that range are 31, 35, 44. That's three.\n\nWait, but wait, the first 31-yard FG is after the first TD, but the text says after the first two TDs, so maybe it's one FG after the first two TDs, making it one 31-yard FG, then two more in the third quarter, 35 and 44.

Let me start by reading the context carefully.\n\nThe context says that in 2007-2008, Sun had a workforce and some financial data. It mentions that Sun announced plans to lay off 5,000 to 6,000 workers, which is 15-18% of its workforce. But the question is about the workforce before the layoffs, specifically how many percent of it was 1000 workers.\n\nWait, the context doesn't directly mention the total workforce before layoffs. It only gives the percentage that was laid off. So I have to infer from the information given.\n\nSun's total workforce before layoffs was such that 15-18% equaled 5,000 to 6,000 workers. Let me set up an equation to find the total workforce.\n\nLet me denote the total workforce as T. So, 15% of T is 5,000, and 18% is 6,000.\n\nSo, 0.15T = 5,000 and 0.18T = 6,000.\n\nWait, that can't be right because if 15% is 5,000, then 18% would be more than 5,000. But the numbers are 5,000 to 6,000, so maybe the percentage is based on the total.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The layoffs were 15-18% of the workforce, resulting in 5,000 to 6,000 workers laid off. So, the total workforce before layoffs would be the number that when 15-18% is taken, it results in 5,000-6,000.\n\nSo, if 15% is 5,000, then the total workforce T would be 5,000 \/ 0.15 = 33,333. Similarly, if 18% is 6,000, then T would be 6,000 \/ 0.18 = 33,333.333... So, the total workforce was approximately 33,333 workers.\n\nBut the question is asking how many percent of the workforce was 1000 workers before layoffs. So, I need to find what percentage 1000 is of the total workforce T.\n\nSo, the formula would be (1000 \/ T) * 100%.\n\nSince T is approximately 33,333, then 1000 \/ 33,333 \u2248 0.03, which is 3%.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If 15% is 5,000, then 1% is 333.333, so 1000 would be about 3.003%, which rounds to 3%.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the higher end, 18% is 6,000, so 1% is 333.333, so 1000 is 3.003%, same result.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the workforce that was 1000 workers before layoffs is approximately 3%.\n<\/think>\n\nThe percentage of Sun's workforce that was 1000 workers before the layoffs was approximately 3%.\n\nAnswer: 3%"}}],"predicted_answer":"3%","reference_answers":["3"],"exact_match":1,"f1":1.0,"fuzzy_match":0.0}

Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nThe context gives the racial makeup of the city as:\n- 57.2% African American\n- 38.3% White\n- 0.2% Native American\n- 1.3% Asian\n- 0.1% Pacific Islander\n- 1.5% from Race (which I think refers to other races)\n- 1.5% from two or more races.\n\nAdditionally, 2.6% of the population are Hispanic or Latino, but that's regardless of race, so it's a separate category.\n\nThe question is asking which racial groups are smaller than 2%. So I need to identify the groups that have a percentage less than 2%.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- African American: 57.2% (way above 2%)\n- White: 38.3% (also above 2%)\n- Native American: 0.2% (just under 0.5%, which is definitely less than 2%)\n- Asian: 1.3% (less than 2%)\n- Pacific Islander: 0.1% (very small, less than 1%)\n- Other races: 1.5% (just below 2%)\n- Two or more races: 1.5% (same as other races)\n\nWait, but the question specifies racial groups. Hispanic or Latino is an ethnic category, not a racial one, so it's not included in the racial breakdown. So the groups to consider are African American, White, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, Other races, and Two or more races.\n\nFrom these, the ones with less than 2% are:\n- Native American: 0.2%\n- Asian: 1.3%\n- Pacific Islander: 0.1%\n- Other races: 1.5%\n\nWait, but the user is asking for groups smaller than 2%, so all of these except maybe the \"other races\" and \"two or more races\" which are at 1.5%. Since 1.5% is less than 2%, they also qualify.\n\nSo the groups smaller than 2% are:\n- Native American\n- Asian\n- Pacific Islander\n- Other races\n- Two or more races\n\nBut wait, the context says \"1.5% from Race (United States Census), and 1.5% from two or more races.\" I think \"from Race\" might be a typo or a specific category, perhaps referring to \"other races\" or \"mixed race.\" So perhaps the 1.5% is the same as the \"other races\" or \"two or more races.\" That might mean that those two categories are the same, each at 1.5%.\n\nSo, the groups smaller than 2% would be:\n- Native American: 0.2%\n- Asian: 1.3%\n- Pacific Islander: 0.1%\n- Other races: 1.5%\n- Two or more races: 1.5%\n\nBut wait, the question is about racial groups. So perhaps \"other races\" and \"two or more races\" are separate, but they both have 1.5%, which is under 2%. So all except African American, White, and Hispanic\/Latino.\n\nWait, but Hispanic\/Latino is a separate category, not a racial group. So the answer should list the racial groups smaller than 2%, which are:\n- Native American\n- Asian\n- Pacific Islander\n- Other races\n- Two or more races\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"other races\" and \"two or more races\" are considered separate groups or if they are the same. If they are separate, then both are at 1.5%.

They had a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. So, the first two touchdowns: one from Tony Romo to Dez Bryant and another from DeMarco Murray. Each touchdown is worth 6 points, so that's 6 + 6 = 12 points for the Cowboys.\n\nThen, the Broncos got on the scoreboard. Peyton Manning threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Julius Thomas, which is another 6 points. So now the Cowboys are up 14-7.\n\nNext, the Cowboys added a field goal by Dan Bailey, which is 3 points, making their score 17-7. That's after the Broncos scored their first touchdown.\n\nWait, but halftime is the end of the first half, so I need to check all scoring events up until the half. So after the Broncos scored their first TD, they added another two touchdowns: one to Eric Decker and another to Thomas, plus Manning rushing for a 1-yard TD on a bootleg. Each of those is 6 points, so that's 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 points for the Broncos in the first half.\n\nThen, the Cowboys got a field goal from Matt Prater with a 48-yard kick, adding 3 more points, but that's after the first half, right? Wait, no.

Then, at the end of the first half, Bailey kicked a 48-yard field goal, narrowing the Broncos' lead to 28-20.\n\nWait, so the halftime score is 28-20 in favor of the Cowboys.

Then they added 21 unanswered points, which includes the two TDs and the field goal? No, the 21 points include the two TD passes and the TD run by Manning, which is 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 points, plus the field goal by Prater, which is 3, making it 21. So after that, the score is 17-7 (Cowboys) + 21 (Broncos) = 38-7? Wait, no, the initial score was 14-0, then 17-7 after the field goal, then Broncos add 21, making it 17-28.

So that's four instances so far: 1568, 1576, 1584, and 1591. Then it goes on to say that war didn't break out again until 1593, which is part of the Long Turkish War. But during the periods of peace between these conflicts, there was this \"Little War\" happening, which involved small-scale warfare without large armies or sustained campaigns. It also notes that both sides wanted peace to continue.\n\nWait, so the question is asking how many times peace was declared. The context mentions the initial conclusion of peace in 1568 and then each renewal. So that's 1568, 1576, 1584, and 1591. That's four separate declarations. The renewals are separate from the initial declaration, so each year counts as a declaration.\n\nI don't think the \"Little War\" is counted as a declaration of peace because that's more about ongoing conflict, even if it's small-scale. The main declarations are the ones in 1568, 1576, 1584, and 1591. So the total number of times peace was declared is four.\n<\/think>\n\nPeace was declared four times: in 1568, 1576, 1584, and 1591.\n\nAnswer: Peace was declared four times."}}],"predicted_answer":"Peace was declared four times.","reference_answers":["4"],"exact_match":0,"f1":0.0,"fuzzy_match":0.0}

The context doesn't give a precise figure, but it does highlight that this was a notable cause of death, leading to the creation of the Geneva Convention.\n\nSo, putting this together, the number of sea men who died is several thousand, as stated in the context.

The largest group is from Turkey with 2,859,000 people. Next is Poland with 1,617,000, then Russia with 1,188,000, and Italy with 764,000. \n\nWait, but the question is about the smallest immigrant group. So I need to find the smallest number among these.

So the smallest immigrant group from Italy. \n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other groups mentioned. The context also mentions Afro-Germans, but that's a different group, not from a specific country. It's about people of African descent in Germany, which is an increase of 46% since 2011.
