However, non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth (12.1%) of the population, down from 34.4% in 1980. Out of all five boroughs, the Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents. 320,640 whites called the Bronx home, of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites. The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent. Italian American numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9% of the population. Irish American numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1% of the population. German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4% and 0.8% of the population respectively.",
      "question": "How many of the whites in the Bronx are Hispanic?",
      "generation": "Alright, so I need to figure out how many of the whites in the Bronx are Hispanic based on the given context. Let me read through the information carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that according to the 2009 American Community Survey, White Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin made up 22.9% of the Bronx's population. It also states that non-Hispanic whites were 12.1% of the population. The total number of whites in the Bronx was 320,640, with 168,570 being non-Hispanic whites.\n\nSo, if the total whites are 320,640 and non-Hispanic whites are 168,570, then the number of Hispanic whites would be the total minus the non-Hispanic. That would be 320,640 minus 168,570. Let me do that subtraction: 320,640 - 168,570 equals 152,070.\n\nWait, let me double-check that math. 320,640 minus 168,570. Subtracting 160,000 from 320,640 gives 160,640. Then subtract the remaining 8,570, which brings it down to 152,070. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, the number of Hispanic whites in the Bronx is 152,070. That makes sense because the context says that non-Hispanic whites are a smaller portion, so the Hispanic whites would be the remainder of the total white population.\n</think>\n\nThe number of Hispanic whites in the Bronx is calculated by subtracting the non-Hispanic white population from the total white population. \n\nAnswer: 152,070",

      "generation": "Okay, so I need to figure out which game made more money between Dachshund & Friends and Labrador & Friends.

Labrador & Friends sold 620,000 copies and earned $19 million. Dachshund & Friends sold 730,000 copies and earned $22 million. \n\nSo, the question is comparing Dachshund and Labrador. From the numbers, Labrador made $19 million, and Dachshund made $22 million. So clearly, Dachshund & Friends sold more money than Labrador & Friends. \n\nI should make sure I'm comparing the right figures. The earnings are in millions, so Dachshund has a higher number. Therefore, the answer is Dachshund & Friends.\n</think>\n\nDachshund & Friends earned $22 million, while Labrador & Friends earned $19 million.

The population distribution is given as percentages. \n\nFirst, under the age of 18 is 21.3%. Then, the next group, 18 to 24, is 14.6%. Comparing these two numbers, 14.6% is less than 21.3%. So, the 18 to 24 group is smaller than the under 18 group. \n\nWait, just to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The percentages are out of the total population, right? So yes, 14.6% is definitely a smaller portion than 21.3%.

      "context": "After the fall of Pegu, remnants of Mon resistance fell back to the upper Tenasserim peninsula , and remained active there with Siamese support. However, the resistance was disorganized, and did not control any major towns. It remained active only because Konbaung's control of the upper Tenasserim peninsula in 1757-1759 was still largely nominal. Its effective control still did not extend beyond Martaban as the majority of the Konbaung armies were back north in Manipur and in the northern Shan states. However, no single southern leader emerged to rally the Mon populace as Alaungpaya did with the Burmans in 1752. A rebellion broke out in 1758 throughout Lower Burma but was put down by local Konbaung garrisons. The window of opportunity came to a close in the second half of 1759 when the Konbaung armies, having conquered Manipur and the northern Shan states, were back down south, preparing for their invasion of the Tenasserim coast and Siam. The Konbaung armies seized the upper Tenasserim coast following the Burmese-Siamese War , and pushed out the Mon resistance farther down the coast.  The resistance was driven out of Tenasserim in 1765 when Alaungpaya's son Hsinbyushin seized the lower coastline as part of the Burmese-Siamese War .",

It says that Konbaung's control there in 1757-1759 was still largely nominal. So, Konbaung's control in that period was not very strong; they didn't really have effective control beyond Martaban because their armies were busy elsewhere.\n\nThen, in 1758, there was a rebellion in Lower Burma that was put down by Konbaung garrisons.
